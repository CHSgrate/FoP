 POLITICS_SERGIY_KRYVONIS_DESC:0 "Born on July 26, 1970 in Kremenchuk,Poltava oblast,Serhiy Hryhorovych Kryvonis had a long but successful military career. Serving as a lieutenant in 10th separate brigade,being a lecturer in the Hetman Sahajdachny Land forces academy,having a position of Chief of the Airborne forces of Ukraine and proving himself as a competent and initiative commander during the deffence of Kramatorsk airport. He was the main proponent for the creation of "Forces of the special operations"(Syly Specialnykh Operacij(SSO)).Several months before the preseidential elections Serhiy Kryvonis was promoted to the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian armed forces. He yet again proved himself after repelling a massive offensive from the Pro - Russian separatists with the army stationed in Donbass. However, with that he failed to support the government in Kyjiv,which largely contributed to Zelensky losing his power across most of Ukraine. Kryvonis now is in tough position:the communications between the government completely severed for the time being,so basically the army is cut off from the capital in Donbas. Furthermore,a slight move in a wrong direction might result in a full-scale offensive coming from the other side of the demarcation line. Whatever the case may be,the Armed forces of Ukraine,headed by its commander-in-chief will repel the invading eastern hordes by any means necessary."
 POLITICS_PENIS_DUSHILIN_DESC:0 "Born on May 9th, 1981 in Makeevka (Makijivka), Donetsk Oblast, Denis Vladimirovich Pushilin has had so far a pretty bizarre life story. Rising through the ranks from a solider in the Ukrainian national guard, being a promoter of famous financial schemes, originally created by the infamous Sergei Mavrodi, later to become a deputy minister of the whole state. After the death of former Donetsk People's Republic president Aleksandr Zakharchenko, Denis Pushilin became the new leader of the republic. Supported by the FSB,he managed to basically install a dictatorship after completely reshuffling the positions in the executive branch of DPR. During the initial instability of Ukraine, his forces managed to inflict large losses on the Ukrainian army with no progress on the frontline ,however. Still, his position is pretty secure. He is mostly a figurehead, while the real power in the country belongs to the Russian oligarchs, the army and Russian intelligence and security services. As long as they are content with his political stances and his position to lead a country, Denis Pushilin's grip power will be secure in the years to come."
 POLITICS_LEONID_PASECHNIK_DESC:0 "Leonid Ivanovich Pasechnik was born on March 15, 1970. During his early years, after finishing the Donetsk military academy, he worked in Ukrainian security services and was pretty successful in this field. However, with him having some problems and turmoils with the "established" corrupt system of the Security services and Ukraine in general, he had quit right before the 2014 riots in Ukraine took place. In the same year, he was made the minister of state security of the newly formed Luhansk People's Republic. After the deescalation of the conflict in Donbass,a new conflict had fired up between Leonid Pasechnik and Igor Plotnicky - president of the republic at the time. Eventually, there was a coup d'etat by the armed forces,supported by DPR. Leonid Pasechnik became the head of the provisional authority of the republic and was later elected as president with the silent approval from Moscow. During the 2019 along with DPR the LPR military attacked the positions of the Ukrainian forces on the Luhansk front, but with no real success."
