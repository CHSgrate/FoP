 POLITICS_SERGIY_KRYVONIS_DESC:0 "Born on 26 july 1970 in Kremenchuk,Poltava oblast,Serhiy Hryhorovych Kryvonis had a long but successful military career path. Serving as a lieutenant in 10th separate brigade,being a lecturer in the Hetman Sahajdachny Land forces academy,having a position of Chief of the Airborne forces of Ukraine and proving himself as a competent and initiative commander during the deffence of Kramatorsk airport. He was the main proponent for the creation of "Forces for the special operations"(Syly Specialnykh Operacij(SSO)).Several months before the preseidential elections Serhiy Kryvonis was promoted to the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian armed forces,he with the army stationed in Donbas repelled the attack of the pro-Russian separatists,but with that he failed to send support to the government in Kyjiv,which largely contributed to Zelensky losing his power across Ukraine. Kryvonis now is in tough position:the communications between the government completely severed for the time being,so basically the army is cut off from the capital in Donbas.Furthermore,a slight move in a wrong direction might result in a full-scale offensive coming from the other side of the demarcation line. Whatever the case may be,the Armed forces of Ukraine,headed by its commander-in-chief will repel the invading eastern hordes by any means necessary."
