 AFU_martial_law_desc:0 "After the sudden attack from the other side of the demarcation line,it has become clear that sooner or later the freezed conflict in Donbas might very well unboil. Hence,martial law was set on the controlled territories of Donets'k and Luhans'k Oblasts.Despite putting a strain on our regional economy and on the local population. It is crucial for maintaining order on our territories. However with the situation in Ukraine slowly going south,we can't be sure for how long we can maintain it with these trends getting worse every day."
 industrial_legacy:0 "Industrial legacy"
 industrial_legacy_desc:0 "Since the first half of XX century the Donbas Industrial Area was and still is the most developed region of Ukraine,be it under Russian Empire,USSR and modern Ukraine. Mainly focused around coal mines and steel mills it has become the beating heart of the region's economy. Hovewer,due to mismanagement in the Soviet Era,very unequal privatisation and corruption in independent Ukraine it has become a shell of a former self - having backwards industrial technology and being a depressing postindustrial region, similar to Northern England in the UK,which has lost most of its massive economic potential with coal mines becoming unprofitable. With the pro-Russian rebellions in 2014,the majority of coal mines,factories,steel mills and other industrial facilities came under control of unrecognized republics,later to be taken and exported to Russian Federation,leaving the area in a terrible shape." 
 AFU_pro_russian_sentiments:0 "Pro-Russian sentiments"
 AFU_pro_russian_sentiments_desc:0 "Many southeastern provinces of Ukraine since Ukrainian independence had a considerable population of Russian sympathizers.In Luhans'k and Donets'k it was more so than everywhere else. Due to Soviet policies of Russification in the area and Holodomor in the 1930s along with urbanization and Russian labour migration made this region to become a heavily russian influenced. As a result,even after the pro-Russian uprisings and their failures to prove an alternative "better life" under a Russian rule,the two oblasts controlled by Ukraine always voted for Pro-Russian parties,such as OPFL. Whilst the problem might be slightly exxagerated,there are still people who would support the Russian rule over a Ukrainian one."

 AFU_nationalist_agendas_desc:0 "During the pro-Russian uprisings in the east in 2014 many Ukrainian patriots and other people,who care about Ukrainian preservation as an independent state went to the frontlines of Donbas as volunteers, later playing a big role of containing Russian advance west. The most prominent and renowned volunteers are "Azov" battalion. Created by far-right footbal fans,they took their part in the deffence of Ukraine and became an integral part of our Armed Forces. Despite being questionable by some left-wingers and liberal journalists for its ideology,majority of Ukrainians,even some pro-Russian ones support them."
 AFU_apathy_of_the_population:0 "Apathy of the population"
 AFU_apathy_of_the_population_desc:0 "A bit similar to Russians, the people on both sides in Donbas dont really care and feel apathy towards politics in the region. "Just leave us alone",thats what many people in these areas would say. Those people are a majority, consisting of middle-age and older populations. This might be a problem,due to their potential unwillingness to take part in this bloody conflict."
