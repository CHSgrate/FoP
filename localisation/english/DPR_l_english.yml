 DPR_rivarly_desc:0 "After Plotnytsky's "resignation", the struggle for financial flows in the 'LPR' between the current militant leader Pasichnyk and the "Minister of Internal Affairs" Kornet did not stop. Moreover, Pasichnyk is trying to push the so-called "Donetsk" out of Luhansk. The so-called Interior Minister Kornet is actually Zakharchenko's man. Pasichnyk is trying to squeeze Kornet's coal industry - legal mines and quarries - away from him. Recently, on "Rossiya 24" TV channel, Pasichnyk, the leader of the self-proclaimed LPR, announced his intention to bring all "state" and non-state coal enterprises of the "republic" out of the shadows. "The policy of approaching state and non-state coal enterprises will be revised to bring out of the shadows those enterprises that are trying to operate illegally. We will do everything possible to legalise them. This is the main task," said Pasichnyk. It is noteworthy that this is not the first time that the DPR's special services have tried to take control of certain financial flows in the territory of the "fraternal republic". In fact, it is a struggle between the leaders of the LPR and DPR for control over financial flows from the extraction and sale of coal, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products."

Decisions on issues common to the union states do not necessarily apply to the territory of each member state of the confederation."

It emerged during the Euromaidan protests, when Russian President Vladimir Putin coined the term "Novorossiya" to refer to Russian claims to southern and eastern Ukraine, named after the historical region of the Russian Empire of the same name. During the pro-Russian protests in eastern Ukraine in Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April-May 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) were formed with Russian support. On 24 June 2014, the DPR and LPR announced plans to establish the Confederation of Novorossia, or Union of People's Republics (UPR), and adopted an act of unification. The United Parliament of Novorossiya was established, with Oleg Tsarev as its speaker, and a draft constitution for the confederate state was developed. In the spring of 2015, as part of the implementation of the Second Minsk Agreement, the Novorossiya project was closed and the act of unification of the DPR and LPR was suspended."

 LPR_democracy_shirm_desc:0 Unlike our Donetsk counterparts, the Luhansk People's Republic has remained committed to democratic values to a certain extent. Although the democratic system in Luhansk is still young, ineffective and at times quite unstable, the government is doing its best and slowly implementing various reforms to make the country's democratic institutions stronger."
