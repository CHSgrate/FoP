 DPR_rivarly_desc:0 "After the "resignation" of Plotnytskyi, the struggle for financial flows in the "LPR" between the current leader of the militants Pasichnyk and the "minister of internal affairs" Kornet has not stopped. Moreover, Pasichnyk is trying to oust the so-called "Donetsk" from Luhansk. The so-called Minister of Internal Affairs Kornet is actually Zakharchenko's man. The beekeeper is trying to squeeze the coal industry out of Kornet - legal mines and pits. At one time, on the air of the TV channel "Russia 24", the leader of the militants of the self-proclaimed "LPR" Pasichnik announced his intention to bring all "state" and non-state coal enterprises of the "republic" out of the shadows. "The policy of the approach to state and non-state enterprises of the coal industry will be revised in order to bring out of the shadows those enterprises that try to work illegally.

Members of the confederation retain their state sovereignty, an independent system of authorities, their own legislation and transfer only a limited number of issues to the Union's competence: defense, foreign policy. A decision on issues common to the Allied States does not necessarily apply on the territory of each member state of the confederation."

It appeared during the Euromaidan, when Russian President Vladimir Putin introduced the term "Novorossiya" into the language to refer to Russian claims to the south and east of Ukraine, named after the historical region of the Russian Empire of the same name. During the pro-Russian protests in eastern Ukraine in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April-May 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) were formed with the participation of Russia. On June 24, 2014, the DPR and LPR announced plans to create the Novorossiya Confederation, or the Union of People's Republics (SNR), and adopted an act of unification. The United Parliament of Novorossiya was created, the speaker of which was Oleg Tsarev, and the draft constitution of a confederal state entity. In the spring of 2015, as part of the implementation of the Second Minsk Agreement, the Novorossiya project was closed, the act on the unification of the DPR and LPR was suspended."
