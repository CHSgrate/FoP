Moreover, Pasichnyk is trying to oust the so-called "Donetsk" from Luhansk. The so-called Minister of Internal Affairs Kornet is actually Zakharchenko's man. The beekeeper is trying to squeeze the coal industry out of Kornet - legal mines and pits. At one time, on the air of the TV channel "Russia 24", the leader of the militants of the self-proclaimed "LPR" Pasichnik announced his intention to bring all "state" and non-state coal enterprises of the "republic" out of the shadows. "The policy of the approach to state and non-state enterprises of the coal industry will be revised in order to bring out of the shadows those enterprises that try to work illegally. We will do everything possible to legalize them. This is the main task," said Pasichnyk. It is noteworthy that this is not the first time when the special services of the "DPR" have tried to take control of certain financial flows in the territory of the "brotherly republic".

During the pro-Russian protests in eastern Ukraine in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April-May 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) were formed with the participation of Russia. On June 24, 2014, the DPR and LPR announced plans to create the Novorossiya Confederation, or the Union of People's Republics (SNR), and adopted an act of unification. The United Parliament of Novorossiya was created, the speaker of which was Oleg Tsarev, and the draft constitution of a confederal state entity.
